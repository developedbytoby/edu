# Video one— [The fetch-execute cycle](https://student.craigndave.org/videos/ocr-gcse-j277-slr-1-1-the-purpose-of-the-cpu-the-fetch-execute-cycle).

### Notes:
- A computer is an electronic device that takes an input, processes data, and produces an output.
- To process data, a computer uses a set of instructions, known as a program.
- Memory stores the program
- CPU executes program
- FDE cycle is executed billions of times/second
- The clock speed of the CPU represents how many times the CPU can execute the FDE cycle.

# Video two— [CPU components and their function](https://student.craigndave.org/videos/ocr-gcse-j277-slr-1-1-common-cpu-components-and-their-function).

### Notes:
- ALU— Arithmetic Logic Unit: performs arithmetic and logic operations.
- CU— Control Unit: controls the flow of data within the CPU.
- Cache: Fast access to memory that's called frequently; generally inside the CPU.
- Registers: Small, fast memory locations inside the CPU. Each has a dedicated purpose.
