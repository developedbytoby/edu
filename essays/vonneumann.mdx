# Notes
- Von Neumann designed computers that stored programs.
- Key characteristics are: CPU, CU, ALU, and an Internal Cache and Clock.
- Each instruction is stored with an address in memory.
- The CPU fetches the instruction from memory, decodes it, and executes it.
- PC holds the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched. It is incremented by one after each instruction.
- MAR holds the address of the memory location to be accessed.
- MDR holds the data that has been fetched from memory.
- The Accumulator is a register that stores the results of calculations.

### Fetch stage
- The program counter is checked as it holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- This address is sent to the MAR.
- The address in the PC is then incremented by one to point to the next instruction.

### Decode stage
- The instruction is in the CU, which decodes it.

### Execute stage
- The CU sends the instruction to the ALU, which executes it.
