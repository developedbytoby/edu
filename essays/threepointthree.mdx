TLDR; The Magisterium is the governing body of the Church. It is a hierarchical structure made up of the Pope and the Bishops.

### Parish Priests:
- Parish priests have the crucial role of caring for the spiritual and emotional needs of a specific area called a parish. They conduct daily Mass and provide sacraments to parishioners.

### Bishops:
- Bishops are responsible for dioceses, which include priests, deacons, and the laity within their jurisdiction. They also administer the sacrament of Holy Orders.

### Archbishops:
- Archbishops hold a higher position than bishops and often oversee an archdiocese, which can encompass multiple dioceses.

### Cardinals:
- A college of bishops, the Pope nominates each of them.
- They are responsible for electing future popes and may oversee specific departments within the Roman Curia.
- They may also serve as a head of a department within the Roman Curia.

### The Pope:
- The Pope is the head of the Catholic Church and is the Bishop of Rome.
- He controls the Magisterium
- He appoints the new bishops to care for the laity.
- He's the successor of St Peter, and therefore has the power and authority passed down from Jesus to Peter to him.
