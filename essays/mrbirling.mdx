My notes on this article: [Character Insights: Mr Birling as a construct](https://educationblog.oup.com/secondary/english/mr-birling-construct).

# Birling's attitude towards his daughter.

- He's essentially willing to sell his daughter on in order to get a business deal. He's willing to sacrifice his daughter's happiness for his own gain.
- The statement "your engagement to Sheila means a tremendous lot to me. She’ll make you happy, and I’m sure you’ll make her happy." is suggesting that only he and Gerald's happiness matters, not Sheila's.
- To him, Sheila is simply a resource to be used to further his own goals.

# Birling's attitude towards his employees.

- Birling is happy to exploit the workers in his factory. In particular, vulnerable female workers.
- He is a perfect embodiment of factory and business owners at the time, who would happily exploit the poor for their own gain.

# How he's presented.
- Birling is presented as foolish. He makes ironic remarks, regarding that the Titanic is "Unsinkable." and that war will never happen.
- He's also presented as arrogant. He's very confident in his own abilities, and is very sure of himself.
- He's also very protective of his reputation. He's very concerned about what people think of him, and is very concerned about his social status.


Mr Birling is a character who really cares about how others perceive him.
He is also a model to the younger generation on how not to act.
