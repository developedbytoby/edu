TLDR; The Bible is made up of many books, written by many authors, over a long period of time. The Old Testament contains a wide variety of literary styles, and the New Testament contains the accounts of Jesus' life.

### Catholic Interpretation:

- Catholics believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God, but written by human authors.
- The key beliefs are God's creation of the world, divine communication through prophets, and the incarnation of God as Jesus.

### New Testament

- **Gospels**: The word "Gospel" literally means good news. The Gospels are Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and were written approximately between 65 and 100 CE.
They are the primary source of information about Jesus' life and teachings. Each Gospel has a different perspective on Jesus' life and ministry.
- **Letters**: These are also called the Epistles, which means a formal letter. They're made up of 21 personal letters, which were mainly written by apostles to their church.
They were often created as reminders to focus on the life and teachings of Jesus.
- **The Book of Revelation**: This book is seen as apocalyptic, which means it describes the end of the world. It's very different to the rest of the New Testament.

### Helpful terms
