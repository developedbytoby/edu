## Denary

- The Human system is called denary. Numbers one through nine are denary.
- Columns are added to every new base.

## Binary

- Base 2 number system
- Each new column doubles the one before.

## Binary - Denary
- Divisions by two - 89/2 = 44 remainder 1, 44/2 remainder 0, 22/2 remainder 0, 11/2 remainder 0, 5/2 remainder 1, 2/2 remainder 0, 1/2 remainder 1, 0/2 remainder 1. = 01011001
- To confirm your answer, you can add all the columns that you got a one in.

## Denary - Binary
- Add all of the columns in which you got one up.

## Adding binary

- **Rules**
    - 0 + 0 = 0
    - 0 + 1 = 1
    - 1 + 1 = 0, carry 1
    - 1 + 1 + 1 = 1, carry 1
- Show carries in the next column, then add to that column.
- If there's an overflow, add an extra column to the left.

## Denary - Hexadecimal

- Hexadecimal is base 16.
- 0-9, A-F
- 10 = A, 11 = B, 12 = C, 13 = D, 14 = E, 15 = F
- Memory addresses, MAC addresses, Hex codes
- MSB = Most Significant Bit — Far left most bit
- LSB = Least Significant Bit — Far right most bit
- Not every denary number will convert to a number with letters in hexadecimal.
