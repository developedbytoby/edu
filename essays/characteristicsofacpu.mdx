Notes made on this video: [GCSE (J277) 1.1 Characteristics of CPUs](https://student.craigndave.org/videos/ocr-gcse-j277-slr-1-1-the-common-characteristics-of-cpus)

# Notes
### Clock speed
- Clock speed measured in Hz
- Numbers of cycles per second
- 3.2GHz = 3.2 billion cycles per second
- Not exactly one to one.

### Size of cache
- Temporary storage for data and instructions
- Located on board the CPU
- Copies of recent data + instructions
- Faster than RAM
- Saves time
- Very expensive

### Number of cores
- Simply, a core is a complete copy of a CPU
- CPUs w/ multiple cores can process multiple instructions at once
- More cores = more instructions processed at once
- Have to stay in time with each other
- Many programs can't use multiple cores
