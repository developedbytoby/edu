TLDR; The Bible, derived from the Greek word "biblia" meaning "books," is a collection of writings by around 40 authors spanning 1500 years. Originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, it holds immense significance in both Jewish and Christian traditions.

### Old Testament (Tenakh):

- Jewish people refer to what Christians call the Old Testament as the Tenakh.
- The first Christians accepted these Jewish Scriptures, as they were of Jewish origin.
- **The Old Testament comprises various types of books, including**:
    - Law: These are commandments from God, known as the Pentateuch or Torah in Judaism. They include Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, containing 613 laws.
    - History: These books narrate the history of the Jewish people, from the Judges to the Persian Empire. Books like Joshua, Kings, and Chronicles are part of this category.
    - Prophets: These writings contain messages from God, often predicting future events and calling for repentance. They also emphasize the covenant. Books from Isaiah to Malachi fall into this category.

### New Testament:

- The New Testament consists of writings by individuals who had access to eyewitness accounts of Jesus' life and work.
- By the third century, the Church established an agreed-upon collection of these writings, considering them genuine and accurate, and thus canonical.
- The Catholic version of the Bible includes 73 books, including deuterocanonical books like Judith, Tobit, and Maccabees, placed either at the end of the Old Testament or integrated into relevant sections based on their content.

### Catholic Perspective:

- Catholics believe that the diverse books of the Bible contain the revealed Word of God in various forms and with distinct purposes.

### What's the Magisterium?

- "Magisterium" originates from the Latin word "magister," meaning master, and shows the authority to teach.
- This authority is vested in the Pope and his bishops and is a gift from the Holy Spirit, given to guide the Church, as exemplified at Pentecost.

### Where did is come from?

- Initially, Jesus trusted the authority to preach and teach the truth of salvation to the apostles. This authority is now referred to as the Magisterium and is made up by the Pope and bishops.

### What are the different teachings?

- Teachings from the Pope are "pontifical" and can be either ordinary or extraordinary.
- Conciliar teachings are when the Pope calls all the bishops together, and they discuss big issues at hand that need an input from the Church; such as nuclear war. There have only ever been 21 of these.

### Ordinary Magisterium:

- The ordinary Magisterium encompasses the daily teachings of the Church found in the words and writings of bishops and Popes, including letters and homilies.
- The ordinary and universal Magisterium is considered infallible and holds complete authority for Catholics.

### Extraordinary Magisterium:

- **This involves infallible teachings on special matters, which occur in one of two ways**:
    - Conciliar: Through ecumenical councils where the Pope gathers all bishops to address disputes or new challenges facing the Church.
    - Pontifical: Through the Pope's ex cathedra declarations, made under very specific and rare conditions.

### Apostolic Tradition:

- Apostolic Tradition includes the oral teachings of the apostles that were not written down but have been handed down through Apostolic Succession, maintained by the Pope and bishops over the centuries.

### Lumen Gentium (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church)

- This document was decided on in the Second Vatican Council.
- It focused on Catholic beliefs about the Church.
- It decided that non-Christians were still able to go to heaven.
- It also encouraged the Bishops to work together as a group.

### Quotes

- "So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by letter"â€”2 Thessalonians 2:15
